                Words feel inadequate right now, but I need you to know how deeply I regret

                for my words in the morning.

                There's no excuse for my actions/words, and I understand that I've hurt you. Seeing you upset because of me is the worst feeling in the world.

                I know I messed up, Surovi. All I can ask is if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, maybe not right away, but eventually. I hope we can talk properly soon.
